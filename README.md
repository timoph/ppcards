Planning poker cards

The original idea was to have a deck of planning poker cards on my phone eliminating the
need for physical cards. Worked well for my purpose back in the day.

This was originally written for Nokia N9. Nokia specific stuff has been now removed.
The application should be usuable with a mobile device that can run a recent version of Qt.
Also works on desktop but it's not very usable there.
